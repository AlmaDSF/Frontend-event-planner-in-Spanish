## Description of the application
In the frontend-event-planner-in-spanish application a calendar is displayed, the image of the space needle is shown as the background, a location to add contact information if the user is interested in subscribing to the newsletter.

The calendar allows users to pick a date. If the user picks a date and there is information in the [backend-event-planner-in-spanish](https://github.com/nancy-lee89/backend-event-planner-in-spanish)  application then the application will display information about an event on that date. 

Once the user clicks a date, the user can have access to the events on the date picked. Each Event listed will have the date, time, and the type of event it is (free, for adults, for families, concert or a sport). As well as the address of the event and a place to click to display the location of the event on a map.
